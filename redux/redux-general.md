# Redux standards and configuration

For state management we will use Redux and Redux Thunk. Redux is a state management library that allows moving state between components in any part of an application and it is made out of 3 main parts:

1. Store

The store is an object that contains the state data saved using Redux.

2. Reducers

Reducers handle the logic involved in saving state to the Redux store.

3. Actions

Actions send the messages and data to the reducers so that they can be intercepted and handled to be saved in the store.

## Directory structure and file names

- Root de Redux: **src/redux**
- Store: **src/redux/store.js**
- Root Reducer: **src/redux/root-reducer.js**

Each piece of state will have a directory with its name where actions, reducers, utils, selectors, types, or any related files will live.

- Reducers: **src/redux/stateName/stateName.reducer.js**
- Actions: **src/redux/stateName/stateName.actions.js**

To differentiate the files, we add the kind of file after the file name.

### Action file name

stateName.actions.js

Example: user.actions.js

### Reducers file name

stateName.reducer.js

Exapmle: user.reducer.js

## Store

The store handles storing the data handled by our reducers and inyecting middlewar.

```
// Standard store file

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { rootReducer } from "./root-reducer";
import logger from "redux-logger";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";

const middleware = [thunk];

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") middleware.push(logger);

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(...middleware));

export default store;
```
